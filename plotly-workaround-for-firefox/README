This is the official plotly.min.js of the plotly.js
library version 1.58.5 with the following fix:

return (
  // Workaround for a bug in firefox, see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=756985
  t.getCTM() === null ? 0 : t.getCTM().e
)+t.getBBox().width

This fix has been incorporated directly into the
minified build, as it doesn't make a lot of sense
to file a proper pull request to upstream for such
an old version of the library.
